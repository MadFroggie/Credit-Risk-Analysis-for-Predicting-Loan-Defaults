## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults, helping financial institutions minimize risks and make informed lending decisions.

- **Business Goal**: Reduce financial losses by identifying high-risk loans.
- **Technical Focus**: Binary classification using customer demographic, financial, and loan-specific data.
- **Primary Metric**: ROC-AUC for measuring the model's effectiveness.

## **Problem Definition**

### **Business Problem**
Financial institutions need to identify loans likely to default to optimize lending decisions and manage risk effectively.

### **Technical Problem**
Build a predictive model using customer demographic and financial data to classify loans as "high risk" or "low risk."

### **Stakeholders**
- **Business Team**: Insights for decision-making.
- **Regulatory Team**: Ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Data Science Team**: Build and evaluate the model.
- **IT/DevOps Team**: Deploy and monitor the model.

### **Success Metrics**
1. **Primary Metric**: ROC-AUC for model discrimination.
2. **Secondary Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-score for evaluating false positives and false negatives.

## **Data Collection**

### **Data Sources**
1. **Public Datasets**:
   - [Home Credit Default Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data).
   - UCI Machine Learning Repository: Default prediction datasets.
2. **Synthetic Data**: Use libraries like Faker or SDV for synthetic data generation.
3. **Company Data**: Historical loan records, credit scores, repayment histories.

### **Feature Categories**
1. **Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status, number of dependents.
2. **Financial History**: Credit score, previous loans, repayment history.
3. **Loan Details**: Loan amount, tenure, interest rate, type of loan.
4. **Behavioral Data**: Payment-to-income ratio, late payment counts.

## **Data Preprocessing**

### **Data Cleaning**
- **Missing Values**:
  - Impute numerical data using mean/median.
  - For categorical data, use mode or create a "Missing" category.
- **Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate records.
- **Outliers**: Detect using boxplots or IQR and handle appropriately.

### **Feature Engineering**
- **Derived Features**:
  - Debt-to-Income Ratio: \( \text{Total Debt} / \text{Monthly Income} \)
  - Utilization Rate: \( \text{Credit Used} / \text{Total Credit Limit} \)
- **Encoding**:
  - One-Hot Encoding: For low-cardinality features.
  - Target Encoding: For high-cardinality features.
- **Scaling**:
  - Standardization: For features with Gaussian distribution.
  - Normalization: Scale values to range [0, 1].

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. **Visualization**:
   - Correlation heatmaps for numerical data.
   - Bar charts and boxplots for categorical features.
2. **Class Distribution**:
   - Analyze the balance of default vs. non-default classes.
   - Apply SMOTE or undersampling if the dataset is imbalanced.
3. **Feature-Target Relationship**:
   - Visualize feature distributions for default vs. non-default groups.
   - Identify strong predictors using univariate and bivariate analysis.

## **Tools and Libraries**
- **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Imputation**: `sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer`, `KNNImputer`
- **Outlier Detection**: Z-score, `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest`
- **Feature Engineering**: `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`, `StandardScaler`

## **Next Steps**
1. Automate data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines.
2. Prepare the cleaned dataset for model training and validation.
3. Transition to the model-building phase using advanced classification algorithms.
